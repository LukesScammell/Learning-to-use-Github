# Learning-to-use-Github
This repository is a test for the Git and GitHub Project linkdin course 
I will use this to learn how to push, commit, pull and many more to my repository.


The Purpose of the .gitignore file is to hide information or personal notes that I dont want anyone accessing my repository to see.
